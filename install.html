  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to bring in and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup 
of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software 
several days in advance.) <em>There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.</em> 
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p> To participate in this workshop, you will need working copies of the software described below. Please 
make sure to install everything and try opening it to make sure it works <em>before</em> the start of your workshop. If 
you run into any problems, please feel free to email the instructor or arrive early to your workshop on the first day.

Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of 
tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.
</p>

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the

  Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.

 <h3>R and RStudio</h3>
  <p> In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the programming language R. 
      To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.</p>
  <p><b>The preferred version of R for this workshop is 3.4.3. Please note that a new version of R will be released on 3/15/18, 
      this will be version 3.4.4. For stability's sake, please install version 3.4.3 if you have not installed R before, or 
      please update to version 3.4.3 if you are using an older version.</p>
